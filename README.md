# BDHC Viewer

A React-based web application for viewing information contained in a BDHC
file and render them.

BDHC files are used by 4th gen PokÃ©mon games to store the height data of
each map.

Check it out online [here](https://kuruyia.github.io/bdhc-viewer/)!

> [!NOTE]
> Compatibility with the different games is as follows:
>
> - Diamond and Pearl: not tested, unlikely to work.
> - Platinum: tested, working.
> - HeartGold and SoulSilver: not tested, may work.

> [!WARNING]
> Code quality may hurt your eyes a bit.

## Getting started

Once you have the repository cloned, running it should be pretty easy:

npm run dev
```

This will start a development server on `localhost:5173`.

Tested with Node.js v23.9.0.
